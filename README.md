<h2>Simple: Geant4 simplified<h2>

Every particle/nuclear/medical/space physicist would have heard about Geant4 or probably even used it for their analysis. A tool designed to simulate particle interactions with matter, it is one of the tools developed at CERN used equally by researchers in academia and industry. Written in C++, it can simulate right from complex particle interactions taking place at the Large Hadron Collider (mother of Higgs Boson - the God particle) to the simple radioactive decay. One can construct detectors, shoot various particles and measure the response using Geant4.

However, it is any beginners nightmare. The learning curve is steep and most of the users tend to copy one of its examples and tweak it to get their results.

In many circumstances, one needs just "ball-park" numbers or just a proof-of-principle of some crazy ideas. To quickly code things in Geant4 and then analyze the data is not easy. The installation and initial settings are not straightforward for the first time users though there exist an excellent user forum and documentation. The code needs to be download and additional libraries have to be pre-installed in addition to the data files which are mandatory for Geant4 to run successfully. In addition, one needs to understand the physics lists and structure of Geant4 to proceed further.

Therefore, having used Geant4 for about 10 years, I thought that a tool with a design similar to RStudio, which helps one to insert detectors, create materials, shoot particles and also to analyze data in a single interface without any coding would be useful to many. Additionally, if the process of downloading and compiling Geant4 could be reduced, it would ease up things. Towards this goal, I built a tool (codename "simple") using Qt, Geant4 and ROOT.

Qt for user interface building, Geant4 as the simulation engine and ROOT for data analysis makes simple a really useful tool for fast simulation and analysis of particle interactions with matter. One can insert new geometries (only Box, Sphere, Cylinder and Wedge available now) and create new material composites from NIST materials. One can choose to record parameters like position, timing, energy and momentum when a particle enters a geometry and the same is stored in a ROOT file for analysis and plotting within the interface. Furthermore, one can create scoring meshes with various parameters and filters. The screenshot shown above is of a simple water cube for measuring the Bragg peak of protons. The design took a few seconds and the run took another few seconds for 10,000 particles.

This tool can also be used as a demonstration tool in nuclear and particle physics/ medical physics classes and can aid in teaching students about data analysis techniques, in general, using external libraries like python.

The application is opensource and will be available for Linux as of now as an AppImage.

The beta version is almost complete but if you are interested in it or would like to know more details, please contact me.
